# Paired agent trials (first valid batch)

**Outcome: graf fails the preregistered agent-trial rule. Nothing is promoted.** The candidate was not cheaper than Graphify plus source reads. Every task and arm summary is in [agent-decision-t.json](../results/agent-decision-t.json). The rule is `agent_trials.rule` and batch `t` in [preregistration v10/v11](../benchmark/preregistration.json).

## Conditions

- **Tasks.** 20 synthetic fault-repair tasks over the pinned Cobra, Flask, and Fastify snapshots ([agent-tasks.json](../benchmark/agent-tasks.json)). Each passes at base, fails after fault injection, and passes when restored. These are harness evidence, not natural held-out issues.
- **Solver.** Claude Code 2.1.302 headless, `claude-haiku-5-5`, the same system prompt, no built-in tools, no user settings, and the task broker as its only MCP server. The per-run cap was $0.50 estimated; no run hit it.
- **Arms.** `graf`: `retrieve` runs `graf locate --text` (binary sha256 `0ea031d9…`, output-identical to the audited build on 1,631 outputs). `graphify`: `retrieve` queries pinned code-only Graphify. Both arms share `read`, `search`, `edit`, `test`, and `finish`.
- **Plan.** 5 attempts per task and arm (200 runs), in a fixed random interleaved order (seed 20261019), on 2026-10-20 under heavy unrelated machine load. Load affects wall time only. Tokens and cost come from provider-reported usage, and the trusted verifier decides success.
- **Cost.** Cost is a list-price estimate under a Claude Max subscription, not a charge.

## Results

| | graf | Graphify |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Verifier success | 100/100 (95% CI 0.963–1.0) | 100/100 (95% CI 0.963–1.0) |
| pass^k, k = 1..5 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| Total estimated cost, all attempts | $0.292 | $0.267 |
| Total tokens, all attempts | 5.37 M | 4.65 M |
| Mean `retrieve` payload (cl100k) | 1,969 | 1,810 |

- **Primary (cost superiority).** Mean per-task reduction −$0.00025 (graf costs more), one-sided p = 0.97. Fail. graf was cheaper on 7 of 20 tasks.
- **Success (non-inferiority, margin 0.10).** Difference 0.00, p < 0.001. Pass.
- **Tokens (secondary).** graf used 7,206 more tokens per task on average (p = 0.92 for a reduction).
- **Biggest per-task loss.** `fastify-hooks-run-after-reply-sent`: 170k vs 81k tokens; `flask-nested-blueprint-subdomain`: 121k vs 75k.

## Interpretation within these conditions

- Both arms solved every task, so these tasks cannot tell the retrievers apart on success. They are too easy for this solver; pass^k is at ceiling.
- The agent usually made one `retrieve` call and then searched and read. A retrieve payload stays in context for every later turn. graf filled the 2K budget and Graphify returned slightly less, which matches the held-out retrieval finding that graf delivers more tokens than Graphify.
- No efficiency claim for graf follows from this batch.

## Invalid earlier batch (exploratory only)

An earlier 200-run batch is excluded. `target/` was deleted mid-batch by a process outside this project. The broker then passed the missing-binary error to the agent as an ordinary tool error, so 88 of 100 graf-arm runs used only regex search and reads. That accidental search-and-read arm cost $0.222 against $0.277 for Graphify, with 97 against 98 successes. It was not preregistered, and it ran at a different time, so it is a hypothesis only: on these tasks, a retriever's payload may cost more than it saves. The raw runs and a note are in `.research/trials/invalid-batch-2026-10-20/`. The harness now refuses to start without a hashed backend and stops on infrastructure errors.

## Next steps

Any new arm must be preregistered before its runs. Candidates suggested by these results: a smaller or self-limiting `retrieve` payload, a search-and-read-only control, and harder or natural held-out tasks that leave headroom on success.
